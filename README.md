# Global Earthquake Activity

This project uses Leaflet.js to visually display eathquake data around the world. The data used is a snapshot of the last seven days of activity, pulled from USGS earthquake feed of GEOJSON data.

The map features:
- Markers indicating where activity occurred
  - Marker size is representative of the magnitude of the quake
  - Marker color is representative of the depth of the quake
- A custom legend
- Two different layers - a street view or topo view
- An informational pop-up with:
  - Description of where the quake occurred
  - The time and date
  - The magnitude
  - The depth
  - A link to additional information on the USGS site
