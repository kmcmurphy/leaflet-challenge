# Global Earthquake Activity

This project uses Leaflet.js to visually display eathquake data around the world. The data used is a snapshot of the last seven days of activity, pulled from USGS earthquake feed of GEOJSON data.

The map features:
- Markers indicating where activity occurred
  - Marker size is representative of the magnitude of the quake
  - Marker color is representative of the depth of the quake
- A custom legend
- Two different layers - a street view or topo view
